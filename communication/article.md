## Before starting writing answer the following questions:

1. **Who** gives a damn about this
2. **What** do I want them to take away from this?
3. **What** is the THESIS SENTENCE?
4. **Why** am I the best person to write about it (and it can be as easy as an answer of “why me”)
5. **Why** now is the best time to write about it (and again, it can be because it’s on my mind)
6. **So what?** I read this article. What lasting impact does the reader have?
