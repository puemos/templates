## Goals

- Personal growth, evaluate your current situation and adapt expectations.
- Team/group growth, how do you feel within the team, are we getting better?
- Vent off, get some things out of your system.

## Structure

I'm using a basic structure which I call "The Traffic Light". Each side will prepare their points divided into Green, Yellow, and Red

**Green** — good stuff that happened, things that are going in the right direction

**Yellow** — heads up, things that are on the wrong path and can still be fixed

**Red** —  Actions or events that happened and will have a negative impact on the growth or operational success

## Process

1. Preparation, During the time before the session, collect points for discussion
2. Communication, 1 day before the session, share a document with the discussion points
3. Introduction, start by asking a simple question, "How are you feeling today?", then refresh the memory with the points of the last session.
4. Discussion, go over the points, write comments
5. Recap, at the end of the session, recap the main takeaways
