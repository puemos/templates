# Initiative:

## Problem Alignment

### The Problem

Describe the problem (or opportunity) you‚Äôre trying to solve. Why is it important to our users and our business? What insights are you operating on? And if relevant, what problems are you not intending to solve?

### High-level Approach

Describe briefly the approach you‚Äôre taking to solve this problem. This should be enough for the reader to imagine possible solution directions and get a very rough sense of the scope of this project. (e.g., if ‚ÄúThe Problem‚Äù was engagement in the design process from non-designers, ‚ÄúThe Approach‚Äù might be a feed which surfaces work that's relevant to them.)

### Goals & Success

What does success look like? What metrics are you intending to move? Explain why these metrics are important if not obvious.

## Solution Alignment

### Key Flows

Show some mocks of the experience. Link to any other documentation as necessary. In general, it‚Äôs helpful to organize these around certain user journeys / use cases. Show enough of a clickthrough where people can walk away with a reasonable understanding of how the product works.

### Key Features and Milstones

Give an overview of what we‚Äôre building. Provide an organized list of features, with priorities if relevant. Discuss what you‚Äôre not building (or saving for a future release) if relevant.

### Open Issues & Key Decisions

Keep track of open issues / key decisions here. Sometimes, certain decisions are made that might feel controversial; document these here so people know that the discussions have happened and there‚Äôs strong awareness of the tradeoffs.
